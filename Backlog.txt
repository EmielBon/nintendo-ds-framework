Completed:
x Separate types into different files.
x Rename TreeMap to Dictionary
x Fully move palettes from TileSet to Tile, so every tile knows exactly what color their pixels are
x Simplify API for tiles
x Let TileMemory::AddTile and PaletteMemory::AddColor return the index they were added to
	Rationale: Often you have to add a tile/color and directly look up the location. This prevents the lookup.
	
Pending:
- Replace all namespaces with a common one like in OpenCV, which uses the cv:: namespace
	- Rationale: namespaces are to avoid naming conflicts, we don't have any in our project. A single namespace is easier to use.
- Turn the engine code into a statically linked library, so the test projects won't have to be rebuilt every time an engine feature changes.
- Move the automatic memory management from the memory classes (BackgroundMemory, PaletteMemory etc.) to a separete class, making all of them simpler to understand.
- Investigate whether it is possible to have directories in gamedata, and implement if so.
- Replace all ASSERT and ASSERT2 statements with the new sassert
- Implement a user-defined literal for fixed point numbers
	- If not possible due to variable decimal point placement, choose either fx12 or fx16 for the literal
- Sort out and reduce the number of includes in headers
- Cleanup debug system
	- Console
	- Make DebugUI work for other classes than Test3D
- Let ContentManager retain weak pointers (WeakPtr) to the loaded resources instead of strong pointers (Ptr)
- Remove all reference members
- Remove all unsigned counters if not needed
- Re-implement GetMap for backgrounds and make it so they always show a map [0..7]. By default Background[i] should show Map[i]

Possibly not:
- Let tilesets with a palette size <= 16 be loaded as 4pp tiles
