                You love playing games on your Nintendo DS. Every game you've
                played has been a wonderful experience, each one leaving a
                lovely aftertaste on your gaming tongue. You may have wondered
                to yourself what it'd be like to create games, to offer your own
                software up for licking. You've drawn diagrams of games you'd
                love to make, worlds you want to share with others. But how to
                go about it? You think and are lost: you are stuck. Where do I
                start? Whats going on inside that pretty little dual-screen
                box?
            </p><p>
                This manual is designed to help you get an idea of whats going
                on inside the Nintendo DS. With a bit of effort and time,
                you'll be on your way to creating your own games. Join us, the
                homebrew community. You'll have a great time giving others a
                great time, collaborating on projects, and feeling the rush of
                intense and under pressure coding for numerous programming
                competitions competitions.

                This manual is the start of the solution. In it, I will cover
                the basics of programming the Nintendo DS starting with an
                explanation of the politics behind the homebrew movement and
                through the emergence of passthrough devices, how to choose
                between a Slot-1 device or a Slot-2 device, , how to choose a
                passthrough device, setting up the programming environment,
                displaying backgrounds, using sprites, and basic game
                programming techniques. All these things will be discussed in
                the context of the creation of a simple game I concocted one
                weekend entitled "Orange Spaceship."

                I assume you know a bit of C or C++ coding. If not, spend at
                least 20 hours making a variety of programs on your own in
                addition to completing some tutorials. It doesn't matter what
                you write, so long as you make sure you have a solid
                understanding of structs, classes, the heap, loops, bitwise and
                logical operators. I recommend the following tutorial and
                reference as a great place to get started learning, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/" target="_top">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/</a> and <a href="http://www.cppreference.com/" target="_top">http://www.cppreference.com/</a>.
            </p><p>
                Next, just read through the chapters one by one, making sure
                you understand the current chapter before moving to the next.
                Code listings will be on a gray background. Follow along with
                the code listings, writing your own code based on the listings.

                Since the Nintendo DS debut, Nintendo enthusiasts ranging from
                pre-pubescent kids to 30-year-old college dropouts have been
                wanting to develop their own games and applications for the
                Nintendo DS. Nintendo has stated that the DS stands for
                "Developer's System". For those worthy enough to land a nice
                developing contract with Nintendo, it truly is. However, most
                people will never receive this contract, special permission
                from Nintendo to commercially produce games for the Nintendo
                DS. In order to obtain a contract with Nintendo, you must prove
                your worthiness by showcasing an amazing game or other piece of
                software to them. You must have a stable financial history and
                expected stable financial future. You must have ample funding
                to buy all the official Nintendo equipment to develop for the
                system. Most game development houses don't even get that far.
                Most games on the market today are put out by what is referred
                to as a publisher. Game development houses will produce their
                game partially, show it to a publisher, and the publisher (who
                already has this development contract with Nintendo) will fund
                the game development house and market their game. All this
                bureaucracy makes it very difficult for the common person to
                produce their own, personal-use games.
            </p><p>
                This is where the homebrew movement comes in. Dedicated
                hobbyists spend weeks reverse engineering the Nintendo DS
                hardware, just to make it possible for common people to produce
                for the system (by providing a cheap alternative to official
                Nintendo development). These dedicated hobbyists come from all
                walks of life and cultures, many from Europe and the U.S., and
                bring with them great knowledge. These people make up the
                homebrew movement.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2543964"></a>Is Homebrew Legal?</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                Homebrew is legal for a number of reasons. You own the hardware
                you reverse engineer, so you are free to do with it as you will
                so long as you don't break the law. Breaking the law would
                include breaking proprietary copy protection, pirating video
                games, publishing illegally obtained trade secrets, or
                otherwise trying to profit off someone else's hard work.
                Homebrew poses no threat to the official developer kit, as it
                is so primitive in comparison. Even if you made something to
                compete with officially produced software, it would be near
                impossible to publish it. Companies often benefit from homebrew
                communities. Although software pirates often steal from
                homebrew discoveries to pirate software, the homebrew community
                abhors piracy and takes a strong stance against it.

                When you buy a piece of hardware, you own it. This means that
                you are free to break it open, dive into it, reverse engineer
                it, and so forth. You may void your warranty, but thats the
                price for learning the intimacies of any system. The only
                illegal things on this line would be to put into production and
                sell products made with patented features (without negotiating
                a production deal with he patent owner), bypassing or breaking
                copy-protection, or stealing software code. Reverse engineering
                to learn about how the hardware works and to make something fun
                for the community is totally fine.
            </p><p>
                The homebrew tools available for game programming are far
                behind anything the game company who produced the system could
                provide (the official development kits). Game system developers
                have an intimate knowledge of the hardware, as they developed
                it. The homebrew community has only outsider knowledge through
                experimentation with the hardware.
            </p><p>
                It would be close to impossible to publish a game made with
                homebrew tools. Nintendo would not license your game. It would
                be hard to find another publisher who would try to publish
                something made with homebrew tools against Nintendo's will. On
                other systems besides the Nintendo DS, this is also true.
            </p><p>
                Companies often don't have a problem with homebrew because it
                increases the demand for their gaming systems and helps them to
                learn more about their consumer base. One example of this is
                with the Xbox. The Xbox homebrew community made the Xbox do
                things that Microsoft never thought consumers wanted like
                playindie games, emulate classic game systems, run the Linux
                operating system, and so forth. Microsoft then included a lot
                of these features (excepting Linux, of course) in their most
                recent gaming console, the Xbox 360 via a system called XNA
                Game Sudio and Xbox LIVE Arcade (XBLA). If a company wants to
                squash homebrew developers for whatever reason, they'll be
                smashing an essential fan base that loves that company's
                hardware design and has the potential to improve it (all at no
                cost to the company). Homebrew caused such a high demand for
                the Xbox that it would not have been in Microsoft's best
                interests to ignore or punish it.
            </p><p>
                The downside of homebrew is that software pirates often steal
                from the discoveries of homebrew and use that information to
                bypass copy-protection and to pirate games. Some companies may
                take a stance against homebrew for this reason, but doing so is
                unproductive. Piracy is regrettably inevitable in any
                industry. It is extremely destructive, annihilating game
                development houses because publishers will no longer publish
                their games due to a high piracy rating on the platform the
                game developers are developing for. Homebrew developers know
                this, and as the amateur brothers of the official game
                developers, they share the pain. Homebrew will usually keep
                all information regarding copy-protection in high secrecy; even
                if they know how to copy games, they will not share the
                information. The homebrew community does not want to see the
                the system they so dearly love come to an early death.

                The purpose of the pass through is to allow the running of
                programs on the Nintendo DS through the Game Boy Advance (GBA)
                cartridge slot. This is done because normal Nintendo DS games,
                which run from the Nintendo DS (NDS) card slot, are encrypted.
                Since it might be illegal to break that encryption, as it is a
                form of proprietary copy protection, we have to get the
                Nintendo DS to run code from a different place than the NDS
                card slot. Also, it is much easier to bypass the encryption
                than to try and break it.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2543404"></a>How a PassMe Works</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                When the Nintendo DS first boots, it reads a header from the
                Nintendo DS card inserted into the NDS card slot. The Nintendo
                DS will read a small block of information from the beginning of
                the game, known as the header, which contains information about
                the game (including the title of the game, date it was released
                and by who, the icon, and some hardware information). This
                header contains a pointer to a location in memory to begin
                executing code. The passthrough's job is to read this header
                and modify it to point to a location someplace on the GBA
                cartridge inserted into the GBA cart slot. What location would
                this be? Why, our code of course.

                DarkFader (Rafael Vuijk) may have been the first to create a
                passthrough device. He designed his passthrough with an FPGA
                (Field Programmable Gate Array) and later packaged it into a
                single CPLD. Many other people (including Kraln, Firefly, and
                Natrium42) have developed a passthrough independently from
                DarkFader, but he is self-credited as its initial creator.
            </p><p>
                Over the next few months following the creation of the
                passthrough, Lynx and Natrium42, both major players in the
                early homebrew community, started their own online stores
                selling pre-made passthrough devices called "PassMe"s. Many
                budding DS programmers bought their first passthrough from Lynx
                or Natrium42's stores (myself included). Lynx's store,
                DSPassme.com, is still up and running today, providing a great
                option when looking to purchase a passthrough device.
            </p><div class="figure"><a id="id2543049"></a><p class="title"><b>FigureÂ 2.1.Â Picture of an early PassMe (left) and an FPGA

                The PassMe was the first device invented to allow homebrew
                software to be run on the Nintendo DS. After Nintendo decided
                to crack down a little harder, in efforts to prevent piracy,
                these devices no longer worked on new Nintendo DS systems. The
                community then developed the PassMe 2. This device was more
                fancy in how it bypassed the copy protection of the Nintendo DS
                and also required the operator to have more resources (a GBA
                flash cart with SRAM) and go through a more involved process.
                After a while, a device called the NoPass surfaced.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2543105"></a>About the NoPass</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                A NoPass pretends to be a real Nintendo DS game card. It
                contains code that is encrypted in the same manner as a real
                Nintendo DS game. The encryption was broken by Martin Korth,
                who discovered a way to dump the Nintendo DS BIOS. He then
                reverse engineered the encryption information from the BIOS
                code. NoPass devices are technically not considered
                passthroughs, since they don't bypass the copy protection of
                the Nintendo DS.

                Recently, due to Martin Korth's work, homebrew engineers have
                discovered a way to create a device that runs homebrew software
                from the Nintendo DS card slot (Slot-1). These new devices
                contain small passthrough devices (of the NoPass style) inside
                them that allow them to bypass copy protection as well some
                means of providing memory to the Nintendo DS (via built-in
                flash memory or a microSD card slot). These devices are called
                "Slot-1 devices". The older style devices that plug into the
                GBA cart slot are referred to as "Slot-2 devices".
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2543146"></a>How do I get a Passthrough</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                Today, many passthrough and NoPass devices are on the market.
                It is highly recommended by the homebrew community to buy one
                from a fellow developer and not a company that commercially
                produces hardware meant for pirating Nintendo DS software.
                Thus, one should not buy a SuperPass or SuperKey from
                SuperCard, a MagicKey or MK4-Mini from NeoFlash, a PassKey from
                G6Flash, a PassKey or Passcard from M3Adapter, or a Max Media
                Launcher from the horrid Datel (a very unprofessional company
                run by immature anti-Nintendo kiddies). Each of these companies
                manufactures hardware that is used to pirate Nintendo DS
                software and should be avoided at all costs. The best place to
                buy a passthrough device today is from <a href="http://www.dspassme.com/oscommerce/catalog/index.php" target="_top">DSPassme.com</a>.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2544497"></a>Which Passthrough Should I Buy?</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                It is recommended that you purchase a NoPass or a Slot-1
                homebrew device, as these work on all Nintendo DS systems with
                no troubles or other complications whatsoever. The older
                passthroughs, like PassMe, don't work on all Nintendo DS systems,
                and the PassMe 2 requires extra work and resources to
                use, not to mention they both stick out of your Nintendo DS
                like a sore thumb and are hard to keep in your pocket.
            </p><p>
                Slot-1 devices also have many other advantages over Slot-2
                devices and passthroughs. You definitely want to get a Slot-1
                device. For instance, Slot-2 devices suck up a lot more power
                than Slot-1 devices do. This means that using a Slot-1 device
                will give you more battery life than using a Slot-2 device.
                Many Slot-1 devices also double as NoPass devices, so you don't
                need to buy both a passthrough and a Slot-2 device anymore.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2544528"></a>How would I choose an old style passthrough?</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                If you still want to buy an old fashioned style passthrough,
                there are a number of things you'll need to consider. Depending
                on what kind of Nintendo DS you have, you can buy either of two
                different types of passthrough devices. The first one, akin to
                the original made by DarkFader, is the "PassMe". The PassMe
                will probably work on most early "phat" (non-Nintendo DS Lite)
                Nintendo DS systems.
            </p><p>
                However, if your Nintendo DS is newer (both phat and Lite
                systems can be new), you will most likely need a "PassMe 2". The
                need for a PassMe 2 came about because of a change in the
                firmware of newer Nintendo DS systems. These newer systems
                do not allow the header to be changed to point to code in the
                GBA slot. However, it is possible to point to code in the GBA
                carts SRAM still. The PassMe 2 points to some certain
                instructions that have been loaded into memory by the currently
                inserted DS game. This location is an SWI (software interrupt)
                call to the SRAM on the GBA port. The GBA carts SRAM contains
                the necessary code to jump to code lo- cated on GBA cart. The
                DS then is told to run this code and thus redirects to code in
                the GBA slot. Each PassMe 2 has to be programmed to work with
                one specific game, as the certain code to redirect to the GBA
                slot is found in different places within different DS games.

                There are a few tricks you can pull to determine your firmware
                version. It involves pictochat and pulling a cartridge out of
                your Nintendo DS. The screen will change a certain color.
                Based on this color you can determine if you need a PassMe 2 or
                not. <a href="#game_eject_firmware_table" title="TableÂ 2.1.Â When ejecting the game, you'll discover your&#10;                firmware version as shown.">TableÂ 2.1, âWhen ejecting the game, you'll discover your

                It is recommended that you purchase a NoPass instead of a
                PassMe or PassMe 2 passthrough device if you are unsure which
                to get, as they are guaranteed to work with all Nintendo DS
                systems, past, present, and future. If you have a friend with a
                newer DS who may need to borrow your NoPass to play your games,
                it's always helpful to have a universal method of running them.

                Hunters Demo or Super Mario 64 DS. Each PassMe 2 must be
                programmed to a specific game and it is best to select a game
                that is in large supply. Also, you'll need a GBA flash cart
                with some SRAM on it. Most GBA flash carts have SRAM, but be
                sure to check your cart before trying to obtain a PassMe 2.
                Some newer GBA flash carts might only support save games on
                flash, so simply knowing that your flash cart supports save
                games isn't enough.

                Using a passthrough device is quite simple. Simply insert a
                game into the card slot on the passthrough and plug the device
                into the DS card slot on the top of your DS, like any other
                game. <a href="#passme_in_use" title="FigureÂ 2.2.Â The PassMe inserted into the DS card slot">FigureÂ 2.2, âThe PassMe inserted into the DS card slotâ</a> illustrates what this
                looks like.
            </p><div class="figure"><a id="passme_in_use"></a><p class="title"><b>FigureÂ 2.2.Â The PassMe inserted into the DS card slot</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/passme_insert_ds.png" alt="The PassMe inserted into the DS card slot" /></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2612004"></a>What to do with your Passthrough</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                One of the best things to do once you get your passthrough is
                to install a patch to your Nintendo DS firmware known as
                "FlashMe." This firmware patch allows for the running of
                unsigned wifi binaries as well as the redirecting of the
                Nintendo DS to boot from the GBA slot in NDS mode. This means
                that after installing FlashMe, you no longer need your PassMe.
                FlashMe is the preferred and recommended method of running your
                own software. You no longer have to lug around a passthrough or
                play with a large block sticking out of the back of your DS.
                Also, you can send your code via wireless multiboot (WMB), if
                you so desire, and avoid having to use a flash cart. In addition
                to all those things, in case you ever come across some
                malicious code that zaps your firmware or otherwise messes up
                your DS, FlashMe keeps a recovery program in the protected
                firmware space that you can run to save your DS. Because of
                this feature alone, FlashMe is better than the standard
                firmware. FlashMe can be obtained from <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/flashme/" target="_top">http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/flashme/</a>.

                There are a few ways of getting your code into the Nintendo DS.
                The first of which is the simple GBA flash cart. These flash
                carts are generally quite expensive, have a low availability,
                and donât hold very much memory. They fit into the phat
                Nintendo DS systems perfectly and do not stick out from the
                bottom, except on the Nintendo DS Lite, as other things do. The
                second way of running code is on a removable memory device.
                These kinds of devices come in two flavors: Slot-1 and Slot-2.
                Slot-2 devices, such as the M3 Adapter, G6 Flash, NeoFlash,
                SuperCard, and the GBA Movie Player, generally support both
                Nintendo DS and GBA software. Slot-1 devices, such as the M3
                Simply, R4DS, M3 Real, DS-X, NinjaDS, and the Cyclo DS
                Evolution, generally only support Nintendo DS software. Slot-1
                devices also fit into the Nintendo DS perfectly. The first four
                of those Slot-2 devices are produced by supporters of piracy
                and should be avoided. It is recommended to use the GBA Movie
                Player (GBAMP) if you want to use a Slot-2 device. With Slot-1
                devices, we don't have too much of a choice but to choose the
                lesser of many evils.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2612105"></a>Which Slot-1 Device should I buy?</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                As there are no homebrew produced devices made by hombrew
                people for homebrew people (yet), we regretfully have to buy
                devices designed and sold for piracy when buying NoPass or
                Slot-1 devices. That said, the most important feature to
                consider when buying one of these devices is DLDI support.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2612122"></a>What is DLDI?</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                DLDI stands for dynamically linked device interface. In order
                for the homebrew filesystem, known as libfat, to work, you'll
                need a device which supports the DLDI standard. DLDI specifies
                a system by which DLDI modules can be dynamically loaded into
                homebrew software. This allows developers to release one
                version of their homebrew which the software end users simply
                patch and then run on a device of their choice. If you buy a
                device that does not support DLDI, you will be out of luck when
                wanted to run a majority of the homebrew applications and games
                out there. Not to mention that the company producing the device
                is essentially saying, "We don't need to spend time catering to
                the homebrew community since our device is designed just for
                piracy." We'd be better off not supporting that kind of company
                with our business.
            </p><p>
                You can learn more about DLDI and how to use it at the DLDI
                Wiki website, <a href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_top">http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=Main_Page</a>.

                There are so many Slot-1 devices on the market today. Choosing
                one of them has become very difficult, as the choices are so
                many. In this manual, I'll discuss the devices I'm familiar
                with, which nifty features they propport, and how they compare
                to one another.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2612177"></a>R4DS</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                This device is built well. It is the most sturdy of the three.
                It uses microSD cards for storage and supports DLDI. This means
                that you can run homebrew software and use the microSD card's
                filesystem. With the most recent firmware, it can even
                automatically patch generic DLDI homebrew software with the
                proper DLDI driver for the R4DS on the fly. This means that you
                don't have to use your PC to patch your homebrew software
                before placing it onto your microSD card. The R4DS cannot use
                microSDHC cards, however. Some people have complained about the
                spring loaded microSD slot, so the makers of R4DS have removed
                it from current models. The R4DS is a great device overall and
                well supported by the Nintendo DS homebrew community, but it
                does not support running GBA software unfortunately.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2612220"></a>M3 Real</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                This device comes in varying configurations for your various
                needs. It comes with both a Slot-1 device and a Slot-2 device.
                The Slot-2 device is what differs between the three M3 Real
                configurations. In the first and cheapest configuration, the
                Slot-2 pack is simply a rumble pack. In the second and more
                expensive version, the Slot-2 pack is a dual rumble and RAM
                pack. This configuration will also run GBA homebrew. The flash
                cart size is kept secret by M3, for some reason. Natrium42 was
                kind enough to inform me that, after doing a few tests on the
                pack, that it is at least 8MB in size, but lacks SRAM. The
                third and most expensive configuration, dubbed the "GBA
                Expansion Package", provides a Slot-2 pack with rumble, SRAM,
                and 32MB of RAM. 
            </p><p>
                The M3 Real supports DLDI as well. I'm not sure if it can
                automatially patch homebrew with its own driver on the fly,
                however. The homebrew software may need to be patched on a PC
                before being transferred to the SD card.
            </p><p>
                The M3 Real supports microSD and microSDHC cards, unlike the
                R4DS. So if you are in the mood for massive storage, the M3
                Real can be your friend.

                This device has very recently come to market, but is already
                making a big impression in the community. The Cyclo DS
                Evolution has the best looking and functioning menu system of
                the three devices, in my opinion. And if you don't like it, the
                menus are skinnable with a number of skins already available
                for the device. You might be thinking, "Why would I care what
                my menus look or act like?" Well, when you use the device to
                load your software over and over and over again, bad menus
                really piss you off. When you can't use the touch screen to
                scroll up and down and select items and have to use the keys,
                but holding down the keys doesn't make the menu scroll by and
                you have to press the up and down buttons a lot to get to your
                software, you get pissed off. And yes, there really are menus
                that are this bad.
            </p><p>
                Aside from the pleasant menus, the Cyclo DS Evolution supports
                DLDI. It also features on the fly DLDI patching. I dislike
                having to patch my games on my PC before loading them onto my
                microSD card, so this is a great feature.
            </p><p>
                My favorite feature of the Cyclo DS Evolution is the "remember
                what I loaded last time and load that same program again"
                feature. Simply holding down L and R at boot will boot the last
                thing that was booted. This enables me to avoid navigating the
                menu system when I'm debugging a program and running it
                repeatedly for testing.
            </p><p>
                The Cyclo DS Evolution also has a NoPass mode where it will act
                as a NoPass to boot your GBA flash carts, a GBA Movie Player,
                or any other Slot-2 device.
            </p><p>
                As you've probably noticed, as I've written the most about the
                Cyclo DS Evolution, that I like it the best of the three
                devices. It is competitively priced with the others, which is
                good. While it doesn't support running GBA software, it feature
                rich on the Nintendo DS side of things. I recommend the Cyclo
                DS Evlolution to meet all of your Slot-1 needs and desires.

                Out of the many places to buy these devices, I've been most
                happy with electrobee. electrobee is run by a trusted member of
                the homebrew community and ships worldwide from good ol' Canada
                (as opposed to who knows where). Their prices are quite often
                the best, too. When you are ready to purchase a Slot-1 device,
                I recommend that you visit <a href="http://electrobee.com/index.php?ref=16" target="_top">electrobee.com</a>.

                If you decide that GBA software development is important for
                you, you might want to consider getting a NoPass and a Slot-2
                device. The NoPass will allow you to run Nintendo DS software
                from your Slot-2 device. The Slot-2 device, on its own, will be
                able to run GBA software. If you only care about Nintendo DS
                software, a Slot-1 device will meet your needs well.
            </p><p>
                The GBA Movie Player is a wonderful device which can run your
                software from a Compact Flash card. Compact Flash cards are
                very cheap and in high supply. If you have more SD cards than
                CF cards around, unfortunately, the only way to run NDS
                software from an SD card at this time is with the SD versions
                of the SuperCard or M3 Adapter. The GBAMP also sticks out from
                the bottom of the Nintendo DS a little, as shown in <a href="#gbamp_vs_gba_flash_cart" title="FigureÂ 3.1.Â Comparison of GBAMP (left) and a GBA flash cart (right)&#10;                inserted into a DS">FigureÂ 3.1, âComparison of GBAMP (left) and a GBA flash cart (right)
                inserted into a DSâ</a>
            </p><div class="figure"><a id="gbamp_vs_gba_flash_cart"></a><p class="title"><b>FigureÂ 3.1.Â Comparison of GBAMP (left) and a GBA flash cart (right)

                With the GBA flash cart, the process of loading your programs
                into memory is a bit slow. Also, each GBA flash cart writer is
                specific to certain carts and often have closed source drivers.
                This means that most flash carts will be incompatible with Linux
                or Macintosh computers. In actuality, the only good thing about
                a GBA flash cart is that it does not stick out from the Nintendo
                DS, as can be seen in <a href="#gbamp_vs_gba_flash_cart" title="FigureÂ 3.1.Â Comparison of GBAMP (left) and a GBA flash cart (right)&#10;                inserted into a DS">FigureÂ 3.1, âComparison of GBAMP (left) and a GBA flash cart (right)

                If you chose to go with the GBA flash cart, you can use a
                utility called Darkainâs MultiNDS Loader to load multiple
                programs onto your flash cart. This way, you donât have to
                re-flash your cart each time you want to run a different
                application.
            </p><p>
                If you chose to go with the GBAMP, then Iâd highly recommend
                DragonMinded's DSOrganize. It supports booting multiple
                programs, text editing, address books, calendars, and more. It's
                a great application for the DS. You can get it from <a href="http://www.dragonminded.com/?loc=ndsdev/DSOrganize" target="_top">http://www.dragonminded.com/?loc=ndsdev/DSOrganize</a>.
                However, you cannot use a stock GBAMP to run NDS programs. You
                have to flash it with some custom ï¬rmware. Instructions and
                firmware are available from <a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NDSMP/index.html" target="_top">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NDSMP/index.html</a>.
            </p><p>
                As for Slot-1 devices, these all usually come with their own
                menu systems (often incorrectly referred to as operating

                devkitPro brand name, like Microsoft or Adobe. You don't use
                devkitPro to build your Nintendo DS software anymore than you
                write your letters with Microsoft or edit photos with Adobe.
                devkitPro produces a collection of toolchains for homebrew
                developers. Toolchains are available for Game Boy Advance,
                GP32, Playstation Portable, GameCube, and the Nintendo DS. The
                toolchain we are most interested in is known as devkitARM.
            </p><p>
                devkitARM is a specific toolchain of devkitPro. It allows the
                compiling of ARM binaries from most all computers. It is based
                on gcc, the gnu compiler collection. devkitARM includes
                everything you'll need to create software for the Nintendo DS,
                GBA, and GP32; all of which are run by the ARM processor.
                However, we will be using something to make our job much easier
                in addition to just devkitARM.

                libnds, the library for Nintendo DS, started out its life as
                NDSLIB. NDSLIB was a simple library created by joat (Michael
                Noland) and dovoto (Jason Rogers). The name was changed to
                libnds over the course of a few months and the maintainer has
                been changed to WinterMute (Dave Murphy).
            </p><p>
                NDSLIB started out as a collection of defines for common memory
                locations in the DS. This is useful, as you can simply
                reference BG_BMP_RAM instead of 0x06000000. Eventually, the
                library began to include structs and unions and other useful
                constructs that help to simplify the programmers job and
                abstract certain portions of the hardware from the programmer.
            </p><p>
                Today, libnds is an incredibly useful library that over 96% of
                the Nintendo DS homebrew community uses.

                Since the beginning of time, humans have used raster displays
                to draw electronic images. Raster images aren't used too much
                anymore, in practice. However, most all displays still act like
                raster displays from a programming perspective. Each physical
                display on the Nintendo DS is actually an LCD screen which
                works nothing like a raster display in actuality, but the
                electronics that control it provide an interface to the
                graphics engines on the Nintendo DS that is very much like a
                raster display.
            </p><p>
                So what is a raster display? Put simply, it is just like a
                television display. A beam of electrons blasts away at the back
                of a phoshor coated screen in a deterministic way (known as a
                raster scan). The beam, from the perspective of a person
                watching the television, travels from left to right, one
                scan line at a time. The beam never blast electrons from right
                to left. After the beam reaches the right edge of the screen,
                it turns off and moves to the right and down one line. When the
                beam finally reaches the bottom line of the screen, it travels
                back up to the upper left of the screen and begins this drawing
                process all over again. <a href="#raster_display" title="FigureÂ 5.1.Â The Raster Display">FigureÂ 5.1, âThe Raster Displayâ</a>
                illustrates this process in an exaggerated fashion.
            </p><p>
                Two things are important to remember here. First, that the
                period of time during which the beam goes from right to left
                (not drawing anything) is called the horizontal blanking
                period, or hblank. Second, that the period of time during which
                the beam goes from bottom to top (again, not drawing anything)
                is called the vertical blanking period, or vblank. Knowing
                about vblank is useful for us as Nintendo DS programmers
                because it is the period of time in which we will tell the
                Nintendo DS to draw things. If we didn't, then the Nintendo DS
                display might be in the middle of drawing the screen when we
                tell it what to draw. This would give us strange artifacts and
                is generally undesirable.
            </p><div class="figure"><a id="raster_display"></a><p class="title"><b>FigureÂ 5.1.Â The Raster Display</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/raster_display.svg" alt="The Raster Display" /></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2612885"></a>The 2D Graphics Engines</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                The Nintendo DS has two screens. As such, it has two graphics
                engines, one for each screen. The first engine is referred to
                as the "main" engine, while the second is called the "sub"
                engine. Both of these engines can put in charge of either
                screen. By default, libnds tells the main engine to operate the
                top physical screen and the sub screen the bottom physical
                screen.
            </p><p>
                Each engine supports up to four backgrounds and up to 128
                sprites. They operate independently of each other, each with
                their own control registers, backgrounds, sprites, graphics
                data, and palettes. To use an engine, we must first turn them
                on. Then we place the engine into a certain mode of operation.
                Next, we map memory for use with the engines. Finally, we load
                their memory with graphics data and palettes and they
                automatically just draw what we've set them up to do.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2612917"></a>The Fifth Mode</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                Each of these graphics engines can be placed into one of seven
                different modes that support different features. In this
                manual, we'll cover one of the more common graphic modes, Mode
                5. It is commonly used because it is very flexible and allows
                for some amazing special effects. We'll learn how to display
                multiple 15-bit color 1-bit alpha <a href="#"><i class="glossterm">affine</i></a> backgrounds in this

                An affine background, also known as an external rotation
                background or exrot background, is one that has the ability to
                be transformed by an <span class="ERROR">&lt;glossaryterm&gt;affine transformation
                matrix&lt;/glossaryterm&gt;</span>. Since linear algebra is beyond the
                scope of this manual, I will cover briefly how to set up a
                basic affine background, but not get into rotating, scaling, or
                sheering it. For this manual, we'll just apply an identity
                transform, a transform that doesn't actually change the
                background, to our backgrounds. With an affine transformation
                matrix, you can rotate, scale, and sheer an affine background,
                among other interesting effects. If you want to learn about the
                cool effects you can do with an affine background and an affine
                transformation matrix, I recommend you look at Cearn's tutorial
                on affine transformations at <a href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/affine.htm" target="_top">http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/affine.htm</a>.

                Since this is the first time in this manual where we'll start
                to write code, we should be aware of the resources available to

                In order to get the hardware to do what we want, we have to
                first initialize it. This means turning on the 2D graphics core.
                This is where we first fall in love with libnds. (We'll fall in
                love with it repeatedly over the course of this manual.) libnds
                makes it incredibly simple to do these two things. Add the

                There are nine VRAM banks in total on the Nintendo DS. See

                Our 16bit background images take up 128KB of memory each. Thus,
                each background has to have one whole VRAM bank assigned to it.
                Not all VRAM banks can be used for all purposes, however. Refer
                to Appendix A, for more detailed information.

                provides access to a background's affine transformation matrix

                shows the names of these variables and which part of the affine

                What we'll do now is add three backgrounds. We'll put a splash
                screen on the top physical screen, a starfield on the bottom
                physical screen, and a planet placed atop the starfield
                background. To do this, we'll use SUB_BG3 (although we could
                use SUB_BG2) for the splash screen and both backgrounds 2 and 3
                on the main screen for the planet and starfield respectively.
                In order to make sure the planet shows up above the starfield
                as opposed to below it, we give the planet a priority number
                less than that of the starfield's priority number. Relatively
                lower priority numbers place backgrounds relatively above other
                backgrounds. There are only four priority numbers per graphics
                engine that we can assign to backgrounds (priority numbers 0-3).
            </p><p>
                We'll now use that nice API libnds provides us for both the
                background control registers and the affine transformation
                matrix. Let's proceed to make a function called <tt class="code"><tt class="function">initBackgrounds</tt></tt>

                What's up with all those "&lt;&lt; 8" thingies? Those are fixed
                point numbers. The Nintendo DS expects many values to be in
                varying fixed point formats. A fixed point number is simply a
                way of specifying multiples of fractions to represent
                non-integer values. For example, if we use an integer variable
                to store a US Dollar amount, we might initially think we can
                only represent whole dollar values. However, if we decide to
                store US pennies in the integer as opposed to whole dollar
                values, we can all of a sudden represent fractions of US
                Dollars with our integer. We can have 1.21 US Dollars by saying
                we have 121 pennies.
            </p><p>
                Common notation for fixed point types looks like 1.31, 1.7.24,
                8.8, and etc. To interpret this notation, we read from right to
                left. First, we find the number of bits used to specify
                fractional parts. The next number will be the number of bits
                for whole number parts. And, if there is another number, it
                will usually indicate the sign of the number as being either
                positive or negative with one bit. <a href="#fixed_point" title="FigureÂ 5.3.Â Integer variables can be used to represent&#10;                fractions.">FigureÂ 5.3, âInteger variables can be used to represent

                numbers.

                DMA stands for Direct Memory Access. DMA allows the reading and
                writing of memory independently of the CPU. The Nintendo DS has
                special, dedicated DMA hardware to do quick and moderately
                effcient moving of memory. DMA is not very efficient for memory
                fill operations, however, as the data to fill with needs to be
                read once for every write. Libnds provides us with a few
                functions to make use of the DMA hardware in the Nintendo DS.
            </p><p>
                Whenever you have the opportunity to use DMA, you should. It is
                always better to use DMA than to use a for loop to copy data.
                When using DMA to copy from main memory, do not forget to flush
                main memory before using DMA. The DMA doesn't use the cache
                where the relevant memory may currently be stored, so flushing
                to main memory guarantees that DMA sees the correct data.
                Another issue to consider would be that in the middle of a DMA,
                the main CPUs are prevented from using certain memory
                hardware. This can
                cause awkward bugs with interrupt handling. For this reason,
                and <tt class="code"><tt class="function">swifastcopy</tt></tt> may be
                safer, and is not too much slower. The safest bet is always
                <tt class="code"><tt class="function">memcopy</tt></tt> and
                <tt class="code"><tt class="function">memset</tt></tt>, if you
                are running into some bugs.
            </p><p>
                The declaration of <tt class="code"><tt class="function">dmaCopyHalfWords</tt></tt>

                In our program, we will use
                <tt class="code"><tt class="function">dmaCopyHalfWords</tt></tt> to
                load some graphics
                into memory. We use the function
                <tt class="code"><tt class="function">dmaCopyHalfWords</tt></tt>
                instead of
                <tt class="code"><tt class="function">dmaCopy</tt></tt>
                because it is more explicit as to
                how it is copying. We'll use the same channel (channel 3) that
                the ordinary <tt class="code"><tt class="function">dmaCopy</tt></tt> uses,
                though. It also let's us specify
                which DMA channel to use when copying. Let's start out by
                writing some functions to display our backgrounds. Since we've
                already set up the hardware to display the data in the desired
                manner, right after the copy we will get some nice images
                displayed on our screens. If we didn't set up our backgrounds
                first, we'd most likely get garbage on the screen until we
                eventually did set up the background control registers.

                The graphics must be in a lossless image format, such as gif,

                makefile. I prefer the png graphic format. Image conversion is
                usually done by a program called <span><b class="command">grit</b></span>. The
                provided template makefile will ask <span><b class="command">grit</b></span> to

                The provided template makefile, adapted from the default libnds

                will look in a folder called <tt class="filename">gfx</tt> (in the
                same directory as the makefile) for your graphics. If any are
                found, it uses a special bin2o rule to tell grit to turn your
                images into .o files, according to grit rule files (with the
                .grit files extension), which can be linked into your program.
                <span><b class="command">grit</b></span> will create a header file (.h) for your
                data. The name format for them works like so: if a file is
                called <tt class="filename">orangeShuttle.png</tt> the header file
                will be called <tt class="filename">orangeShuttle.h</tt>. Inside
                this header file will be a reference to the data in the .o,
                named orangeShuttleTiles and orangeShuttlePal or
                orangeShuttleBitmap, depending on how the grit file specifies
                which format to convert your image into. It will also include
                the length in bytes of the data references as
                orangeShuttleTilesLen and orangeShuttlePalLen or
                orangeShuttleBitmapLen.

                To use grit, we make a grit rule file. This file has the .grit
                file extension an contains important information telling grit
                how we want our image converted. You can learn about how grit
                works by reading its built-in help by running the command
                <span><b class="command">grit</b></span> with no parameters. I've also provided
                commented grit rule files for all images we will use in this
                manual. These make good examples and can help you get the hang
                of using grit.
            </p><p>
                For more information regarding grit, you can visit the project
                homepage and read the grit manual at <a href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/grit/" target="_top">http://www.coranac.com/projects/grit/</a> and <a href="http://www.coranac.com/man/grit/html/grit.htm" target="_top">http://www.coranac.com/man/grit/html/grit.htm</a>

                No, sprites are not magical fairies. It is a term in 2D
                graphics programming which refers to an image or animation. The
                Nintendo DS has dedicated hardware for dealing with sprites.
                This makes the system very useful for 2D. Most gaming systems
                do not have a 2D core, and all sprites and other 2D graphics
                have to be handled manually by painting 2D images on the side
                of a quad within 3D space.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2614177"></a>The OAM</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                The OAM manages all the sprites. This is an immense job, most
                of it done behind the scenes for us. After using it, you might
                think it magical. It's not as magical as it seems, however. OAM
                stands for Object Attribute Memory. It is the place in memory
                we use to keep track of and control our sprites. The OAM works
                with a SpriteEntry and a SpriteRotation struct to manage the
                attributes of our sprites.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2614195"></a>Information About the Sprite Hardware</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                On the Nintendo DS, we can have up to 128 sprites. Only 32 of
                those sprites can be affine transformed (rotated, scaled,
                skewed, etc.). We are also only allowed to address 1024
                different tiles to comprise all of our sprites, per engine.
                Sprites can be made of tiles that use 16 colors or of ones that
                use 256 colors. Tiles that use 256 colors are twice as large as
                tiles that use only 16 colors. Another advantage of using
                16-color sprites is the ability to use 16 different palettes.
                When using 256-color sprites, each sprite (and tile) must use
                the same palette. When using 16-color sprites, we can have one
                sprite use one 16-color palette and another sprite use a
                different 16-color palette, even though both use the same tile
                data. Games often use this trick to make different colored
                enemies that look the same. The sprites still use the same tile
                data, but they use different palettes.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2614225"></a>How Sprites are Stored in Memory</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                Sprites are broken into 8x8 pixel pieces. This is called
                tiling. When drawn to screen, the hardware pieces these tiles
                together, like a puzzle where the pieces have no distinguishing
                edges. There are two ways to tile sprites, 1D and 2D. In a 2D
                layout, the sprite memory is treated like a giant image from
                which sprite tiles are obtained by making a box the size of the
                sprite and placing it over the giant image. In a 1D layout, the
                sprites are layed out in a linear fashion, as discussed in
                <a href="#sprite_tile_layout" title="FigureÂ 6.1.Â &#10;                    The upper text shows information as it would be on a&#10;                    non-tiled background. The lower text shows the same data,&#10;                    tiled, for use in tiled graphic modes.&#10;                ">FigureÂ 6.1, â
                    The upper text shows information as it would be on a
                    non-tiled background. The lower text shows the same data,
                    tiled, for use in tiled graphic modes.
                â</a>.
            </p><p>
                The conversion process is very similar to that for backgrounds.
                We simple make grit rule files that tell grit how we want our
                images converted, and it generates a .o and a header file for
                us. The grit rule files and image files go into the same place
                as background images, the <tt class="filename">gfx&gt;</tt> folder.

                Sprites have three attribute variables associated with them.
                With them, sprites can spin and flip and mosaic and perform all
                sorts of fun hardware effects. Each attribute is multi-purpose
                and requires some amount of bit twiddling and masking to
                achieve the affects we want. That is, it would if it weren't
                for this nice SpriteEntry union which libnds provides for us.
                In most cases, we will use this union to do what we'd like to
                with our sprites, but there are special cases where this is not
                possible.
            </p><p>
                We will cover how to update, initialize, and rotate using bit
                twiddling methods, as libnds doesn't yet provide ways of doing
                this otherwise. libnds provides the means to do other things
                that we'll be doing with sprites though, like move them, we'll
                be doing. We'll use the libnds API wherever possible. Let's
                write some functions to do each of those, in that order.
            </p><p>
                I provide you with a header file, located with the acompanying
                source at
                <tt class="filename">code/chapter_6-sprites/include/sprites.h</tt>
                that contains a collection of sprite related function
                declarations. We'll be working on the definitions for each of
                these functions together in a new file called
                <tt class="filename">sprites.cpp</tt>. Our first step will be to
                create a that new source code file. Put a new file called
                <tt class="filename">sprites.cpp</tt> into the
                <tt class="filename">source</tt> folder of your project directory.

                Instead of keeping track of things directly in the OAM, we'll
                manage a copy of the OAM in memory that we will copy over every
                frame using <tt class="code"><tt class="function">updateOAM</tt></tt>. The
                reason we do this is because writes to OAM are locked during
                all times but during vblank. We will wait for vblank to occur
                before copying our copy of the OAM into the actualy OAM.
            </p><p>
                Updating the OAM is very straightforward. We do this by copying
                our copy of the OAM to the real OAM. Our copy of the OAM might
                still be stuck in the cache and may not have made it into main
                memory yet, so we first flush local memory (a must whenever
                performing a DMA operation) to ensure that DMA sees the correct
                data. The data we want to copy might be stuck in cache still
                and may not have made it into main memory yet. Then, we tell
                the OAM to look into the OAMTable instance we will create later
                for information about each one of our sprites.

                Let's get to spinning. This is a bit more difficult than what
                we've done before, but still fun. It's nice to not have to make
                a separate sprite for each rotation position the sprite will be
                presented in. However, doing so may be necessary for some
                applications as the Nintendo DS rotation won't always look as
                pretty as if the rotations had been done elsewhere.
            </p><p>
                The libnds's sin and cos lookup tables employ a 32768 degree
                system. Humans usually use a 360 degree system or radians. The
                angle we'll work with in this function will be one that is part
                of the 32768 degree system. You'll have to convert your radians
                or weird 360 degree value (Seriously, why 360? Silly
                Babylonians.) to the 32768 degree system before using this
                function in order to see the results you are expecting.
            </p><p>
                We have to use a transformation derived from our time spent
                playing with an affine transformation matrix. The sprite's
                affine transformation matrix is used slightly differently from
                the background affine transformation matrix. If you have a
                background in linear algebra, I'd recommend reading up on this

                Up until now, we haven't used the fancy SpriteEntry union

                hiding sprites, we still need to be thinking about these bits
                due to an oddity in the Nintendo DS hardware: the hiding bit of

                bit of a sprite if the sprite is an affine sprite (bit 8 of

                Now for some real fun. Moving sprites in hardware, and not
                having to worry about clipping, buffers, or anything, is such a
                wonderful feeling. To move a sprite, we simply change the
                SpriteEntry properties x and y. This is a case where we
                don't have to think much about the underlying arrangement of
                this information. The libnds union SpriteEntry describes the
                organization of data to the compiler for us and the compiler
                then figures out the best way to operate on that data; the
                compiler does the bit twiddling and masking for us. Since this
                is so simple, we don't even need to write a function to do it
                for us. So just take note of what we do here and remember it
                for later; you don't have to write a function for it, but if
                you want to I'd recommend making it an inline function.

                The ability to set a sprites priorty is essential when dealing
                with multiple sprites, as we will be doing. As such, we'll now
                discuss sprite priorities and how to set them.
            </p><p>
                A sprite, like a background, has a priorty which determines how
                the sprite will appear with respect to other sprites and to
                backgrounds. A sprite with the same number priorty as a
                background will appear above it. A sprite with a lower priorty
                number than another sprite will appear above that other sprite.
                There are four priorities per graphics engine available for
                sprites, similar to background priorities.
            </p><p>  
                To set the sprite priority, we'll simply set the SpriteEntry
                property priority to one of four different values, depending
                on which priority we wish to assign: OBJPRIORITY_0,
                OBJPRIORITY_1, OBJPRIORITY_2, or OBJPRIORITY_3. The following
                code listing shows an example of what this looks like.

                So put away your sprites.cpp file into the source directory of
                your home folder and let's get back into our

                We'll need to make a place for our sprite data to live in VRAM.
                Since we will be using sprites on the main graphics engine, we
                can use VRAM bank E for our sprites. VRAM bank E is smaller
                than the other VRAM banks we've dealt with so far, as it is
                only 64 KB in size. However, this is more than enough to store
                1024 unique 16-color tiles.
            </p><p>
                In our <tt class="code"><tt class="function">initVideo</tt></tt>, we need
                to map VRAM bank E for use with sprites on the main graphics
                engine. Then, we need to tell the main engine to enable sprites
                of the tiling style we want. We will use 1D tiled sprites. The
                resulting initVideo function, post-modifications, is presented

                We'll be using the same memory alignment (boundary) as the GBA
                uses for our sprites. Tile VRAM addresses must be aligned to 32
                bytes. If you feel shorted by this, since you can't use all
                1024 addressable tiles when using 256 color tiles, for
                instance, then you can look up how to use other alignments at
                <a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#dsvideoobjs" target="_top">http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#dsvideoobjs</a>.
                You'll have to set REG_DISPCNT (via videoSetMode) with a value
                defined in <tt class="filename">libnds/include/nds/arm9/video.h</tt>
                akin to DISPLAY_SPR_1D_SIZE_XXX (the default, and the method
                the GBA and we use, is DISPLAY_SPR_1D_SIZE_32).
            </p><p>
                To compute the address to copy tiles to, we basically need to
                know two things: the memory alignment we are using and the tile
                numbers we want to assign data to. Using the formula from
                Martin Korth's GBATEK, "TileVramAddress = TileNumber *
                BoundaryValue", and libnds's SPRITE_GFX define we can compute
                the address of any tile as follows.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
static const int BOUNDARY_VALUE = 32; /* This is the default boundary value
                                       * (can be set in REG_DISPCNT) */

            </pre><p>
                We usually want to copy more than one tile into vram at a time,
                however. Luckily, when converting images to sprites with grit,
                it will tell us the length in bytes of our tile data for that
                sprite. After we have the length in bytes, we can use
                dmaCopyHalfwords (which uses byte lengths for copying) to copy
                the tile data into VRAM. We can also calculate how many tiles
                an image uses from its length in bytes by diving the length in
                bytes by how many bytes a tile takes up. In our case, as we'll
                be using 16-color tiles, a tile (8x8 pixels) takes up 32 bytes.

                In the above code, you'll find some things that look like
                function calls to a function called <tt class="code"><tt class="function">assert</tt></tt>. These aren't
                actually function calls, but macro expansions. You'll have to
                include <tt class="filename">assert.h</tt> in order to use them.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
            </pre><p>
                The assert macro allows the programmer to make assumptions
                about what is going on in the code. To use them, you just place
                some kind of "fact" in between the paranthesis. Whenever this
                assumption fails, the program will quit. Assertions are
                evaluated at runtime.
            </p><p>
                Assertions help you avoid bugs developing obscure later on
                since they'll stop them right where something first goes wrong.
                Assertions are a good thing and should be used often.
            </p><p>
                When you release a production version of your software, the
                assertions can be removed from your code by the preprocessor.
                To do this with a GNU compiler, like the ones we are using, you
                simply set NDEBUG.

                Object oriented programming (OOP) is essential to making good
                games on a modern system. Although it is very much possible
                without object oriented programming, OOP is an incredible tool
                that greatly improves code reusability, readability,
                modularization, and abstraction. It makes the programmer's job
                a lot easier. Also, due to modularization, collaborating on
                projects with your friends or coworkers is easily ten fold
                easier.
            </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2615550"></a>The Ship Class</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                The first thing we'll make is a Ship class. This class will
                encapsulate all the properties and functionality of any ship in
                an easy to use and understand format. Think of things a ship
                can do, on a high level. What should come to mind is the
                ability to turn both ways, shoot weapons, accelerate, move at a
                given velocity (coasting), and maybe some more things if you
                are creative enough. What properties of a ship can you come up
                with? Perhaps turning speed, thrust, mass, maximum speed,
                velocity, position, shields? Well, after you are done
                brainstorming, the next step is to write out the functionality
                and properties we need to put into our Ship class. You could
                make a table, as in <a href="#ship_properties_and_functions" title="TableÂ 7.1.Â Table of Ship properties and functionality.">TableÂ 7.1, âTable of Ship properties and functionality.â</a>, or draw some
                diagrams on a piece of paper. Either way, you want to make sure
                your ideas all get onto some physical paper before you begin
                coding.

                you don't explicitly make them. Feel free to modify the default

                changing the ship properties.

                Acceleration is probably one of the most important things your
                ships can do. To accelerate, we simply increase our velocity by
                a certain increment, that being the thrust capability of the
                ship, in the angle we are headed. Here is where some simple
                trigonometry comes into play. Since our velocity is stored as a
                two dimensional vecotr (x and y component), we have to shadow
                our thrust vector onto each direction. We do this we multiply
                the thrust by sin(angle) for our x component, and by
                -cos(angle) for the y direction. Next, after we have computed
                the increment for both x and y, we add them onto our current
                velocity, making sure we donât go over the ship's maximum
                speed.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
void Ship::accelerate() {
    float incX = thrust * sin(angle);

    //a more accurate method is needed at a later time

                our current velocity. This will get the angle of our velocity

                This one is a bit more tricky and involved. I suppose I should
                start by explaining that a Nintendo DS circle has 32768
                degrees. It doesn't actually have 32768 degrees, nor does a
                Nintendo DS even know what a circle is, but it is easy to
                understand the hardware a bit better when we think of it this
                way. I will say, however, that the reason for the 32768 degrees
                is due to libnds's built-in look up tables for the sin and cos
                functions. Having only 360 entries in your lookup table would
                be a waste of space when it takes just as many bits to index
                into a 360 entry table as it does a 512 entry one. libnds gives
                us more accuracy by presenting a 32768 entry one. More
                entries allow finer accuracy. In order for the Nintendo DS to
                know how to rotate our sprites, we have to convert the
                internally stored radian angle value to a value within the
                32768 degree system. This is an easy conversion.
            </p><p>
                The first step is to convert to a 360 degree system, as you
                must have learned in junior high school. This is done by
                multiplying the radian value by 180/PI. The 180 part is half
                the number of degrees in a circle. So, in a 32768 degree system
                we can convert by multiplying the radian value by
                DEGREES_IN_A_CIRCLE/(2 * PI). Lastly, just return that value as
                an integer. (The hardware does not have any floating point, so
                when rotating our sprites, we use a fixed point value disguised
                as an ordinary integer.)
            </p><p>
                Then, we make a function to return a converted angle value, for
                whenever we need it.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
int Ship::radToDeg(float rad) {
      return (int)(rad * (DEGREES_IN_A_CIRCLE/(2 * PI)));
}
int Ship::getAngleDeg() {
      return radToDeg(angle);
}

                We now need to create an instance of the ship in our main
                function. Creating an instance of a class, known as an object,
                is quite simple, as you can see below. We just have to create
                the Ship object and then assign a SpriteEntry to it.
            </p><p>
                We should also do something nifty with our new class so that we
                can verify that what we wrote is working. Let's make the ship
                move around on its own by telling the ship to trust ten times.

                The previous code isn't very exciting, since we never update
                the OAM more than once. We need to begin the creation of what
                is referred to as the game loop. We won't be fully implementing
                it in this chapter, since a major component of it will be
                missing until we discover input on the Nintendo DS.
            </p><p>
                The game loop has at least three major components. The first
                thing any game loop should do is to collect input from the
                outside world. We won't be doing that in this chapter, however.
                The next component of the game loop is updating the game state.
                Based on inputs the game received in the previous frame (to the
                one we'll render next) and the passing of time, the game state
                will change (if anything interesting is happening). The final
                component of the game loop is the rendering component. In our
                case, we have to update the OAM to let it know of the changes
                that occured in the game state and that it needs to reflect
                those changes.
            </p><p>
                Now that we know what a game loop is, it's time for us to start
                creating one to run our program. The first thing we want to
                happen in our game loop is for the game state to be updated.
                This is because we don't have any input to collect yet. We tell
                our ship to move at it's current velocity. This will change
                the shipâs position. Then we update the sprite attributes with
                new information about our ship, as some properties of the ship
                have now changed (i.e. its position). Finally, we call a
                function that will make sure our program does not exceed 60fps
                (speed of the graphics on the Nintendo DS) by waiting for
                vblank, and then we update the OAM, telling it that we changed
                some attributes on the sprites and it needs to handle that.
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
    for (;;) {
        /* Update the game state. */
        ship-&gt;moveShip();

        /* Update sprite attributes. */
        MathVector2D&lt;float&gt; position = ship-&gt;getPosition();
        shipEntry-&gt;x = (int)position.x;
        shipEntry-&gt;y = (int)position.y;
        rotateSprite(shipRotation, ship-&gt;getAngleDeg());

        /*
         *  Update the OAM.
         *
         *  We have to copy our copy of OAM data into the actual OAM during
         *  VBlank (writes to it are locked during other times).
         */
        swiWaitForVBlank();
        updateOAM(oam);
    }

    return 0;
}
            </pre><p>
                The OAM really shines through here. The all powerful Nintendo
                DS hardware, an incredible masterpiece, will rotate and move
                our ship with very little effort on our part. In hindsight, all
                we have done is flip a few bits in a few registers in a
                structured manner, and our ship comes to life. Incredible.

                The Nintendo DS has many different user input systems,
                including buttons, touch screen, and a microphone. Most video
                game systems only have buttons and an analog stick or two.
                While the Nintendo DS does not have an analog stick, it does
                have an amazing touch screen which has millions of different
                creative uses. We will only cover the touch screen and buttons,
                though. If you wish to learn more about the microphone, I'd
                recommend reading, although a bit outdated, the only microphone
                resource I know of <a href="http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/nds_develop9.html" target="_top">http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/nds_develop9.html</a>.

                libnds provides us with a very nice abstraction for key input.
                Instead of having to AND registers with cryptic masks to
                discover which keys we are pressing, we simply call <tt class="code"><tt class="function">scanKeys</tt></tt>, then check
                one of three input functions, <tt class="code"><tt class="function">keysDown()</tt></tt>, <tt class="code"><tt class="function">keysHeld</tt></tt>, or <tt class="code"><tt class="function">keysUp</tt></tt>. In order to
                see which keys have been recently pressed, use <tt class="code"><tt class="function">keysDown</tt></tt>. To see
                which keys are currently held, use <tt class="code"><tt class="function">keysHeld</tt></tt>. To see

                this, we detect when the Nintendo DS has the up key on the
                D-pad held (which included the initial down press) and
                accelerate the ship if so. The up key will constantly read as
                held, so long as it is held. Reading the input does not affect
                the keys register. We'll do similar things for each of the

                As you've noticed, having that Ship class made input handling
                extremely easy. Our keys will directly affect various
                properties of the ship as we press them. This is really
                amazing, but the true miracle is yet to come.
            </p><p>
                As for the moon, since we didn't make one class for it, the
                code came together a little more messily. We also had to pass
                two parameters to the <tt class="code"><tt class="function">handleInput</tt></tt> function
                to represent the moon portion of the game state instead of one.
                If we had wanted to be more clean, we could have even produced
                a game state struct that contained all the game state and all
                operations on it in one place.

                Let's check back in on our <tt class="code"><tt class="function">main</tt></tt> function now.
                We need to make some adjustments to our game loop since we've
                now added the ability to collect input and to react to input.
                The first thing we now want to happen in our game loop is for
                the key registers and read touch screen coordinates to get
                updated. We make a call to updateInput and it all happens for
                us. Next, we handle the input we just received by calling our
                recently created <tt class="code"><tt class="function">handleInput</tt></tt>
                function, passing in our game state so that it can change it

                Sounds are essential in any game. Our little project should be
                no exception. Sounds bring life to various elements in the
                game, such as space ships, weapon systems, rain, sword
                clashing, car engines, and so forth.
            </p><p>
                Many games don't need music. For instance, a game with the
                programmer's or game designer's favorite song may annoy many
                players who have different tastes in music. Instead, give the
                player the option to listen to their own music, on their own
                audio equipment. Not to mention, music can be costly in data
                size.
            </p><p>
                Sound effects on the other hand, are quite useful. A word of
                warning, however, a game with bad sounds (scratchy, annoying,
                too repetitive, etc.) is worse than a silent game. Take care
                when engineering sounds for your game.

                The Nintendo DS has amazing sound hardware. We will only be
                able to scratch the surface of it, and even still, we won't
                leave any scratch marks. The Nintendo DS has 16 channels to
                play sounds, numbered 0 through 15. Channels 8-15 are special
                channels. All channels can play ADPCM or PCM sounds, while 8-13
                are the only channels that can play PSG sounds and 14-15 the
                only that can generate noise. We will only be experimenting
                with PCM sounds.

                To play our sounds, we will use the unbelievebly impressive
                homebrew audtio library, maxmod. maxmod is distributed with
                libnds, so you should already have it installed. maxmod can
                play music as well as sound effects, in such formats as mod,
                it, s3m, xm, and wav, but we'll just be using it as a wav
                player to play our sound effects. For more information and
                deeper coverage of the library, visit <a href="http://maxmod.org/" target="_top">http://maxmod.org/</a>.

                The makefile I've included with my manual has a custom rule for
                creating a <tt class="filename">soundbank.bin</tt> file from all
                audio files in the <tt class="filename">audio</tt> project folder.
                The rule runs mmutil to create the
                <tt class="filename">soundbank.bin</tt> and
                <tt class="filename">soundbank.h</tt> files. The bin2o rule turns
                the .bin file into something safe to link into your nds file
                and creates the <tt class="filename">soundbank_bin.h</tt> file. All
                of these header files will be located in the
                <tt class="filename">build</tt> folder after a build, if you wish to
                review their contents.

                Now it's finally time for some code. maxmod simplifies sound
                playing quite a bit. All we need to do is initialize the
                library, let it know where our soundbank is, load the sound
                from our soundbank, and call a function to play the sound. It
                will serve our purposes for now, as a springboard into more
                advanced forms of sound. Enough with the chatter, here's some
