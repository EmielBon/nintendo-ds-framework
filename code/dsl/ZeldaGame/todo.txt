x SpriteSet[i], replace indexer with .at(i) and create that function in SpriteSet 
x Sprite.SubImageIndex = 0, Sprite->SubImageIndex = 0

Load<T>
x Resolve namespace of T (resolved by only allowing member names unqual to type names)
	
For the above:
x Scan for all complex members for member., e.g. Sprite.
x Replace . with ->
- Todo: Lists

x Output generated classes to nintendo-ds-engine/code/armx/[include|source]
- Optional inheritance
- Fix projectwide unique membername constraint in . for -> replace pass 
- Multiple member, single type definitions (e.g. fx12 x, y;)
- Use UniversalIndentGUI for formatting the generated files
- Add support for constructors
- Proper Initialization order
